## My process

### Build with

- ![Vite][vite]
- ![NPM][npm]
- ![HTML][html]
- ![CSS][css]
- ![Tailwind CSS][tailwind-css]
- ![Google fonts][google-fonts]
- ![Flexbox][flexbox]

### What I learned

1. <strong>Vite for Modern Development</strong>: Vite turned out to be a great tool for modern front-end development. It made everything faster and smoother with quick builds and live updates. I learned how to:

   - Set up a project using Vite and connect it to my HTML and CSS files.
   - Use Vite’s dev server to see changes right away without refreshing the page.
   - Build and optimize the project for production using Vite’s build command.

2. <strong>Using NPM for Tailwind CSS</strong>: NPM helped me manage everything needed to run Tailwind CSS. Here’s what I learned:

   - Installing Tailwind CSS: I used NPM to install Tailwind and its tools, which made setting things up easier.

3. <strong>Tailwind CSS Utility-First Workflow</strong>: Tailwind CSS introduced me to a utility-first approach where styles are applied directly in the HTML markup using pre-defined classes. Some key takeaways:

   - Rapid prototyping with utility classes like `flex`, `items-center`, `bg-grey-800`, etc.
   - Custom spacing using classes like `p-6`, `gap-4`, and `rounded-xl`.
   - Responsive design with breakpoint-based classes like `md:w-[24rem]`.

   - This made styling extremely fast without having to write custom CSS (except for custom themes or colors, which were configured in the Tailwind config).

### Useful resources

- [Vite - DOCS](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) - This helped me understand how to set up a project using Vite and connect it to my HTML and CSS files.
- [Tailwind CSS - DOCS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) - This helped me understand how to use tailwind css for styling the html page.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - A great resource for importing fonts easily and making text look unique.
